The only way to rice on Windows.

This is a small experimental setup that makes Windows look and feel more like a modern tiling desktop environment. It combines three applications:

1. GlazeWM – a tiling window manager for Windows.
2. Zebar – a customizable status bar.
3. AutoHotkey script  (optional) – an experimental keymap to toggle on transparent window.
